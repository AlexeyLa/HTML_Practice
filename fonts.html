Today's your lucky day. Look around, <span>kiddo - it's all yours.</span> You are now the owner of this fine establishment. Free? Oh ladies, cover your ears. No... not free. Look, hey... this is a squeaky clean, highly profitable (at least potentially), local institution. Look the bottom with favor by the chamber of commerce, better business bureau at three-hundred and twelve thousand dollars, it's a steal.

Don't you get it? On the outside it's a nail salon right, on the inside it's the best money laundering a growing boy could ask for. Wait, wait! Come back here. Sit. Come on, come on... humor me here for a second. You know you need to launder your money, right? Do you understand the basics of it - placement, layering, integration. Well, you wanna stay out of jail don't ya? You wanna keep your money and your freedom. Cause I got three little letters for ya, I - R - S. If they can get Capone, they can get you.

Hand me that little thing, bin. This is the nail salon, right. I take your dirty money and I slip it into the salon's nice clean cash flow - that's called layering. Final step - integration. The revenues from the salon go to the owner - that's you! Your filthy drug money has been transformed into nice clean taxable income brought to you by a savvy investment in a thriving business. Yeah and if you wanna stay a criminal and not become say a convict, then maybe you should grow up and listen to your lawyer.
